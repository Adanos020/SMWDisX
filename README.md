# SMWDisX
(Yet another) disassembly of Super Mario World.
This disassembly will focus on code readability and the ability to assemble any of the four releases of the original game (J, U, E 1.0, & E 1.1).

# How to Assemble
You'll need the assembler, Asar (you can find it [here](https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&s=tools)).
1. Click the big green "Clone or download" button and select zip file.
2. Unzip that somewhere, and stick asar.exe in the folder with PATCH.bat.
3. Open smw.asm and change the variable !V to correspond to the version of the game you want to assemble.
4. Run the bat file. The assembled ROM will be called "smw.smc."
